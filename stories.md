# Stories & Storybooks

Online stories are created for children by educational experts, parents, or kids. And a series of stories make up a storybook.

For example, Tom has a storybook continuously created by his parents and himself: The Adventures of Tom.

Stories are multimodal: visual stories by parents, voice stories by kids, et al.
