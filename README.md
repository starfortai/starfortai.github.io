# Starfort: AI Games for Family Education

"Stories are at the core of human experience, and every technological change paves the way for new forms of stories."


The Starfort AI platform transforms wonderful ideas from educators or parents of children into engaging AI-powered interactive stories, i.e., 3D narrative games + AI NPCs, for kids to read, play, and chat. Agents as NPCs, having conversations, interacting, guiding, and inspiring children.
